      <p>Probably, the best hookah bar in the World! Hookah lounges are commercial establishments where people gather to
        smoke flavored tobacco from a hookah pipe.
        Other names for a hookah lounge include hookah bar, hookah cafe, hookah den, and shisha bar.
        Originating in India and spreading to several Middle Eastern countries, traditional hookah lounges are coffee
        houses that also serve hookah.
        However, as they have gained popularity in Western cultures, many hookah bars in the United States have evolved.
